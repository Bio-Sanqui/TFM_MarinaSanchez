# TFM_MarinaSanchez
This repository was created to contain the code used in the master's thesis titled "Exploring large vision-language models with prompt engineering for peripheral blood cell image analysis and classification" by Marina SÃ¡nchez.

In the "GPT-4 Prompts" folder, you will find the code and prompts used to test the capabilities of **GPT-4** for peripheral blood cell image analysis and classification. These can be used by inserting your OpenAI key in the "api_key" variable. To experiment with other GPT-4 models, replace the "model" variable inside "payload" with "gpt-4-vision-preview" (GPT-4V), "gpt-4-turbo" (GPT-4 Turbo), or "gpt-4o" (GPT-4o). The images used to perform few-shot prompting with these models are available in the "Cell images" folder. 

**WEB APPLICATION**
The .py and .html files used to create the web application with Flask are available as "app.py" and "index.html".
