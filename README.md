This repository was created to contain the code used in the master's thesis titled "Exploring large vision-language models with prompt engineering for peripheral blood cell image analysis and classification" by Marina SÃ¡nchez.

You will find the code and prompts used to test the capabilities of GPT-4, Claude3 and LLaVa for peripheral blood cell image analysis and classification. The images used to perform few-shot prompting with these models are also available in the "Cell images" folder. 

The .py and .html files used to create the web application with Flask are also available as "app.py" and "index.html".
